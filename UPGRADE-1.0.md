# Upgrade to 1.0

## No more `gotoDetails() and `gotoReference()` in column scope

If you wrote a custom FieldView, you probably based the Link widget on the ones bundled by ng-admin:

```js
// in MyCustomFieldView.js
export default {
    ...
    getLinkWidget:   () => '<a ng-click="gotoDetail()">' + module.exports.getReadWidget() + '</a>',
    ...
};
```

The `gotoDetail()` method is no longer in the execution scope of `maColumn`, the directive which includes the link widget. Instead, it uses the `ui-sref` directive (from ui-router) to make the link visible and right-clickable:

```js
// in MyCustomFieldView.js
export default {
    ...
    getLinkWidget:   () => '<a ui-sref="{{detailState}}(detailStateParams)">' + module.exports.getReadWidget() + '</a>'
    ...
};
```

You should upgrade your existing FieldViewConfigurations to reflect that change.
